Welcome to our hospital. We are here to provide you with quality medical attention. To receive our services, please follow these administrative steps. First, please register at our admission desk and show us your identity card and insurance card (if any). We will give you a medical record number and a consultation room number. Second, please wait for your turn to see the doctor and get a diagnosis and a prescription. Third, please pay for the consultation fee and any other charges at our cashier. If you have insurance, please fill out a claim form and submit it to the insurance company or our insurance desk. Fourth, please collect your medicines from our pharmacy and follow the doctorâ€™s instructions. Some of these steps may be digitalized, such as online registration, electronic medical records, digital payment and verification. This may make the process faster, easier and cheaper, but it may also require you to have internet access and a smartphone. Thank you for choosing our hospital. We hope you have a good recovery.
